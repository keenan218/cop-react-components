# Inset text

A block of text that is inset.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <InsetText>
      The changes will show in your profile when they accept your request.
    </InsetText>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Details summary="Properties" className="no-indent">
  <Props of={ InsetText } />
</Details>

# Variants
## With markup

A block of markup that is inset, showing it supports something other than plain text.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Markup">
    <InsetText>
      <ol>
        <li>Check your answers carefully</li>
        <li>Don't make a mistake</li>
      </ol>
    </InsetText>
  </Story>
</Canvas>


## When to use this component
Use the inset text component to differentiate a block of text from the content that surrounds it, for example:

- quotes
- examples
- additional information about the page

## When not to use this component
Some users do not notice inset text if it’s used on complex pages or near to other visually prominent elements.
For this reason, avoid using inset text as a way of highlighting very important information that users need to see.

If you need to draw attention to very important content, like legal information, use the <Link href="/?path=/docs/d-warningtext--default-story">warning text component</Link> instead.


## How it works
Use inset text very sparingly - it’s less effective if it’s overused.

There are 2 ways to use the inset text component. You can use HTML or, if you’re using Nunjucks or the GOV.UK Prototype Kit, you can use the Nunjucks macro.
